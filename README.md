![image]()
## 1. Introduction
Welcome to my personal project focusing on **Austin Airbnb data analysis**. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the Airbnb rental market has flourished. Simultaneously, Austin's real estate market has remained highly active due to the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Through this project, which involves data cleaning, **SQL** exploration queries, **Tableau** dashboard visualization, I aspire to uncover valuable insights and trends in the Austin Airbnb market, fostering personal growth in data analysis and visualization techniques.

The main tools I used through this exploratory analysis project are **EXCEL**, **MySQL** and **Tableau**.
